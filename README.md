# Booklist APP
Currently building a basic prototype that will integrate book reviews from
multiple sources.

## Douban_Scrap_Comment.py
It has a `read_print_loop` to present short comments from Chinese website
Douban.com by inputing some search term.
Done by scrapping the website. This project is really meant to practice working
with BeautifulSoup package to scrp html/xml. 
A better way to access website data is, of course, using the site's offical
API. 
Douban.com has its won API:
